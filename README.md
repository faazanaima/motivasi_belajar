# Analysis of Universitas Mercu Buana Students' Learning Motivation Using the Random Forest Algorithm

This project aims to analyze factors influencing student learning motivation at Universitas Mercu Buana by building a predictive model using the Random Forest algorithm. Data was collected through a questionnaire with 81 samples and 14 features, covering variables such as student status, major alignment, GPA, campus location, and lecturer competence. Preprocessing included GPA normalization, category merging, and handling irrelevant features and class imbalance using class weighting and SMOTE. The initial model achieved 88.24% accuracy, with techniques like threshold tuning and oversampling improving minority class detection. The analysis highlights key factors such as GPA, major alignment, and semester level, providing insights to help universities develop targeted strategies for enhancing student engagement and academic performance.
